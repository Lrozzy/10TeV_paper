# Instructions

This repo contains a jupyter notebook that runs through functions for analysing and plotting muon gun data in the tracker for the 10 TeV paper. 

Please feel free to edit the style of the plots - I have offered suggestions using either mplhep or generic matplotlib formats.

The folder `json_data` contains non-BIB data but for BIB data please go to the OSG cluster into the directory `/scratch/lrozanov/mucolstudies` and download the following into your working directory:

* v0_BIB_0_50.json
* v0_BIB_50_250.json
* v0_BIB_250_1000.json
* v0_BIB_5TeV.json
* v0_BIB_all.json
